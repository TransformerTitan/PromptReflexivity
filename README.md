**Prompt Reflexivity as a Signal of Agentic Trustworthiness in Large Language Models**

A lightweight, prompt-based evaluation framework for assessing the meta-cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through their ability to reflect on and self-assess their own outputs.

## 🎯 Overview

As LLMs transition from static text generators to autonomous agents, traditional evaluation methods fall short of capturing crucial meta-cognitive behaviors like error recognition, uncertainty estimation, and self-correction. **PromptReflexivity** introduces a novel evaluation paradigm that probes these capabilities through a simple two-stage prompting approach.

### Key Features

- 🔍 **Lightweight Evaluation**: No fine-tuning required - works with prompt engineering alone
- 🚀 **Model Agnostic**: Compatible with both open-source and API-based models
- ⚡ **Efficient**: Complete evaluation runs in under 4 hours on a single GPU
- 📊 **Multi-Domain**: Covers reasoning, ethics, planning, and common sense tasks
- 🎯 **Trust-Focused**: Measures trustworthiness beyond traditional accuracy metrics

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TransformerTitan/PromptReflexivity.git
cd PromptReflexivity
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- torch >= 1.9.0
- transformers >= 4.21.0
- sentence-transformers
- openai (for API models)
- anthropic (for Claude models)
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from prompt_reflexivity import ReflexivityEvaluator

# Initialize evaluator
evaluator = ReflexivityEvaluator(model_name="gpt-4")

# Run evaluation on a single prompt
task_prompt = "If all cats are mammals and some mammals are not pets, does it follow that some cats are not pets?"
results = evaluator.evaluate_reflexivity(task_prompt)

print(f"Consistency Score: {results['consistency_score']:.3f}")
print(f"Self-Correction: {results['self_correction']}")
print(f"Reflection Depth: {results['reflection_depth']}/5")
```

### Full Benchmark Evaluation

```python
# Run complete benchmark evaluation
benchmark_results = evaluator.evaluate_full_benchmark()

# Generate report
evaluator.generate_report(benchmark_results, output_file="reflexivity_report.json")
```

## 🧠 Methodology

PromptReflexivity uses a two-stage evaluation process:

### Stage 1: Initial Task Prompt
The model receives a task prompt `T` and generates an initial response `R₁ = M(T)`.

### Stage 2: Reflexivity Prompt
The model is presented with its initial response along with a reflexivity prompt `Pᵣ`, generating a reflexive response `R₂ = M(T, R₁, Pᵣ)`.

Example reflexivity prompts:
- "Can you double-check your answer?"
- "Is there any part of your response you think might be incorrect?"
- "Think step-by-step and re-evaluate your conclusion."

## 📊 Benchmark Dataset

Our benchmark consists of **50 carefully curated prompts** across four domains:

| Domain | Count | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Reasoning** | 15 | Logic puzzles, arithmetic, deductive inference |
| **Ethics** | 10 | Moral dilemmas, fairness scenarios, value judgments |
| **Planning** | 10 | Multi-step tasks, strategy formation, optimization |
| **Common Sense** | 15 | Real-world knowledge, social norms, causality |

The complete benchmark is available in `data/benchmark_prompts.json`.

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

### 1. Consistency Score (CS)
Measures semantic similarity between initial and reflexive responses using sentence embeddings.

```python
CS(R₁, R₂) = cos(Embed(R₁), Embed(R₂))
```

### 2. Self-Correction Rate (SCR)
Proportion of cases where the model successfully identifies and corrects errors.

```python
SCR = (# Corrected Responses) / (# Total Error Cases)
```

### 3. Reflection Depth (RD)
5-point Likert scale rating the quality and insightfulness of reflexive responses based on:
- Reasoning explanation
- Assumption identification
- Uncertainty expression
- Alternative proposals

## 🎯 Results

Our evaluation across major LLMs reveals significant variation in reflexivity capabilities:

| Model | Consistency Score | Self-Correction Rate | Reflection Depth |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **GPT-4** | 0.78 | 45% | 4.2/5 |
| **Claude 2** | 0.74 | 42% | 3.9/5 |
| **LLaMA2-13B** | 0.63 | 25% | 3.1/5 |
| **Mistral-7B** | 0.59 | 22% | 2.9/5 |

## 💻 Usage Examples

### Evaluate Local Model

```python
from prompt_reflexivity import ReflexivityEvaluator

# For local models (LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)
evaluator = ReflexivityEvaluator(
    model_name="meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf",
    device="cuda",
    load_in_8bit=True
)

results = evaluator.evaluate_reflexivity(
    task_prompt="What is the capital of Australia?",
    reflexivity_prompt="Please double-check your answer. Is it possible you made a mistake?"
)
```

### Evaluate API Model

```python
# For API-based models
evaluator = ReflexivityEvaluator(
    model_name="gpt-4",
    api_key="your-openai-api-key"
)

# Batch evaluation
prompts = [
    "Solve: If a train travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed?",
    "Is it ever acceptable for an AI to lie? Explain your reasoning.",
    "Plan a 3-day itinerary for a tourist visiting Paris for the first time."
]

batch_results = evaluator.evaluate_batch(prompts)
```

### Custom Reflexivity Prompts

```python
custom_reflexivity_prompts = [
    "Are you confident in this answer? What could go wrong?",
    "If someone were to critique your response, what might they say?",
    "Can you think of any counterarguments to your position?"
]

evaluator.set_reflexivity_prompts(custom_reflexivity_prompts)
```
